        <p>“One day a group of friends realized the relationship between food and happiness. They then set out to share this with the world. Three Chefs' vision came to life in this space we now know as Earth & Sky Raw Vegan Cafe. And with you, we will continue to grow.”
            <br><br><br>
            Welcome to Earth & Sky Raw Vegan Cafe, a conscious company committed to sharing clean delicious wholesome and living foods that nourish the body with energy and love.  Earth & Sky Raw Vegan Cafe’s doors opened in Central Park West November 24, 2007.  We built Earth & Sky Raw Vegan Cafe from the ground up, fueled by love and determination to share how wonderfully delicious plant-based healthy foods are.<br><br>

            While on a personal journey seeking happiness, health, and that feeling of being “alive”, we realized the powerful connection between the food we were eating and how we were experiencing our lives. In discovering what foods work best for us and our body, we changed the course of our lives from feeling ‘sick and tired’ all the time to feeling inspired into action to live an energized, creative, passionate, purpose driven, and fun life.<br><br>

            We only hope for Earth & Sky Raw Vegan Cafe to offer a space that invites its guests to have a memorable and delicious experience that might plant inspirational seeds to live the life they truly want to live.<br><br>

            Earth & Sky Raw Vegan Cafe’s menu offers accessible and delicious “clean” and gluten-free dishes to be enjoyed by all food lovers (everyone). We specialize in organic, plant-based, vegan, raw living food cuisine that integrates macrobiotic foods and philosophy.  We are also known for our gluten-free vegan baked goods and raw desserts.</p>
